Hi there! I'm Zhilin and I work on Aligning LLMs to be more helpful for humans! My recent work focuses on leading the HelpSteer dataset series (1, 2 and 3), which are popular open-source post-training datasets for helpfulness modelling. Then, I explore creative ways to model such data, giving rise to the Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct and Reward models, as well as the Llama-3.3-Nemotron-70B model family.

I also do some hobby projects in my personal capability outside of work - such as Humanoid Agents (Platform for simulation for human-like agents).



[comment]: Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
